PIG needs Perl to run and ImageMagick to generate thumbnails, you can get the
sourcecode from from perl.com and imagemagick.org if they're not included in
your operating system or distribution.

No attempt will be made to maintain any kind of documentation in the
distributed tarball, documentation is avalable at http://pig.berlios.de/
