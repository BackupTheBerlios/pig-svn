PIG needs Perl to run and ImageMagick to generate thumbnails, you can get the
sourcecode from from perl.com and imagemagick.org if they're not included in
your operating system or distribution.

Instructions:

Copy 'config.pl.sample' to 'config.pl' ( if you move it 'make distclean' won't
work ). Then edit the variables in that file according to instructions there.

Then place directories containing image files in $img_src as defined by 
'config.pl', there are currently two limitations to this:
	1. $img_src/ itself must not contain other files than directories.
	2. $img_src/*/ must not contain other files than directories.
Both these limitations are scheduled for removal, but currently you'll have to
live with them.

Now run 'make' and a 'index.php' file will be generated, to view it properly
you'll have to do 'make install' if you're using a sever with FTP upload or
manually transfer the files to a web server supporting PHP, this is because
css.php still depends on PHP ( again this is due to be fixed ).
