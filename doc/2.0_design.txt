Design notes for 2.0:

Abilities: same as 1.0 except i'll be able to put directories inside img/orig/
like 'img/orig/2004-04-04_Swimming' ( ISO Dates ). 


echo foo | sed s/foo/$(pwd| sed s/\\//\\\\\\//g)/
echo DSCF0027.JPG|sed s/$/05b01eb42f23f5446e29884e6f46711743e71a0c\.jpeg/


Workflow:

* Startup
* Read the config file
* Write out some basic stuff to the index.php file, everything except the areas containing the pictures.
* Write out an index to the index.php file.
* Make a list of everything in img/orig/ we assume every folder has the format:
	"YYYY-MM-DD Description with an arbitery amount of spaces"
This can be broken down to:
	Year: 		1-4 Character
	Month: 		6-7 Character
	Day:		9-10 Character
	Description:	>13 Character
lets say this returns:
	2004-04-06 Outside by the sea/
	2004-04-06 Trip with international line/
The system would now start some for-loop that would list ever one of those directories:
	2004-04-06 Outside by the sea/
		IMG_0001.JPG
		IMG_0002.JPG
		{...}
	2004-04-06 Trip with international line/
		IMG_0001.JPG
		IMG_0002.JPG
	2004-04-07 Dykning teori i kolding/
		IMG_0001.JPG
		IMG_0002.JPG
It would then merge the directory and filename into one and place them inside 'img/gen/' like so:
	( note that ' ' has been replaced with '_', this is to avoid redundant %20 all over the place )
	'img/gen/2004-04-06_Outside_by_the_sea_IMG_0001.thumb.JPG' # A thumbnail
	'img/gen/2004-04-06_Outside_by_the_sea_IMG_0001.JPG' # A modified version of the original that is smaller, but still has the same name

* After each picture
